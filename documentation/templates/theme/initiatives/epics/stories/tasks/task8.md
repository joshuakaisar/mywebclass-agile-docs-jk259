Task Title: Accessibility Audit and Implementation

User Story: As a website administrator, I want to ensure that the website is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, so that they can access the content and functionality of the website.

Description: The task involves performing a comprehensive accessibility audit of the website to identify accessibility issues and areas that need improvement. The audit should follow established accessibility guidelines and standards, such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). The identified issues should be documented along with recommendations on how to fix them.

Once the accessibility issues have been identified, the next step is to implement the recommended fixes to ensure compliance with accessibility guidelines. This might include updating website code, adjusting website design and layout, adding alternative text to images, and improving website navigation.
