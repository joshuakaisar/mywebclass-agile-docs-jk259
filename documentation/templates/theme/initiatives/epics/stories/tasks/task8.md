Task Title: Accessibility Improvements

User Story: As a website administrator, I want to ensure that the website is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, so that they can access the content and functionality of the website.

Description: This task involves two main steps: performing an accessibility audit of the website and implementing the recommended fixes. The accessibility audit should follow established accessibility guidelines and standards, such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), and should aim to identify accessibility issues and areas that need improvement. The identified issues should be documented along with recommendations on how to fix them.

Once the accessibility audit is completed, the next step is to implement the recommended fixes to ensure compliance with accessibility guidelines. This might include updating website code, adjusting website design and layout, adding alternative text to images, and improving website navigation.
