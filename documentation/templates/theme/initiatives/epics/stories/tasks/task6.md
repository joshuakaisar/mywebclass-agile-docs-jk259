Task Title: Develop User Interface Customization Interface

User Story: As a content administrator, I want to be able to customize the website's user interface, so it reflects the organization's brand and provides an engaging experience for learners.

Description:
Develop a user interface customization interface that includes options to customize colors, fonts, layouts, and manage images and multimedia content. The interface should allow content administrators to make changes in real-time, and the changes should be reflected immediately on the website. The customization interface should have appropriate validation for inputs to ensure that options are within acceptable ranges and that all required fields are filled out. Also, provide a preview option to enable administrators to preview their changes before they are applied to the website. The customization interface should be user-friendly, with clear instructions and explanations for each option. Additionally, appropriate security measures should be implemented to prevent unauthorized access to the customization interface.

Acceptance Criteria:

1. The customization interface should be fully functional and allow administrators to customize the website's user interface.
2. The changes made to the user interface should be reflected across the website immediately after they are made.
3. The interface includes appropriate validation for inputs, provides a way to preview changes, and is easy to use with clear instructions and explanations for each option.
4. The customization interface is secure and prevents unauthorized access.
