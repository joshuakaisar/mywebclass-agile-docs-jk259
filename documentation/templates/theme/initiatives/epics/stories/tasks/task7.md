Task Title: Implement Web Accessibility Guidelines

User Story: As a website administrator, I want to ensure that the website is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, so that they can easily navigate and use the website.

Description: This task involves researching and implementing web accessibility guidelines and standards to make the website accessible to all users. The first step is to research the guidelines and standards set forth by organizations such as the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Based on this research, specific changes need to be made to the website, such as:
1. Providing alternative text descriptions for images and multimedia content to ensure they can be interpreted by screen readers.
2. Ensuring that all website functionality can be accessed using a keyboard for users who cannot use a mouse.
3. Using high-contrast colors and clear, easy-to-read fonts to make text more visible.
4. Providing closed captioning or transcripts for all videos.
5. Ensuring that all forms and interactive elements are accessible to users with disabilities.

Once these changes have been implemented, the website should be tested with a variety of assistive technologies, such as screen readers and magnifiers, to ensure that it is fully accessible. The acceptance criteria for this task include:
1. All images and multimedia content on the website have alternative text descriptions.
2. All website functionality can be accessed using a keyboard.
3. The website uses high-contrast colors and clear, easy-to-read fonts.
4. All videos have closed captioning or transcripts.
5. All forms and interactive elements are accessible to users with disabilities.
6. The website has been tested with assistive technologies to ensure full accessibility.
