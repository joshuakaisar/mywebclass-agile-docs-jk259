Task Title: Develop a Content Management System with User-friendly Interface

User Story: As a website administrator, I want a content management system that is easy to use, so that I can easily manage and organize website content, set user permissions, and preview content before publishing.

Description:
Develop a content management system (CMS) with a user-friendly interface that allows website administrators to easily manage and organize website content. The CMS should have the following features:

User permissions: The CMS should allow administrators to set user permissions, so that different users can have different levels of access and control over website content.
Content creation and editing: The CMS should allow administrators to create and edit website content, including text, images, videos, and other multimedia content.
Content organization: The CMS should allow administrators to organize website content into categories, tags, and other relevant taxonomies, so that it is easy for users to find and navigate.
Preview before publishing: The CMS should allow administrators to preview content before publishing it, to ensure that it looks and functions correctly.
Search functionality: The CMS should have a search function that allows administrators to quickly find and edit content.
Version control: The CMS should have version control features that allow administrators to track changes to content and roll back to previous versions if necessary.
