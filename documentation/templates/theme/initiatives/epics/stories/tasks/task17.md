Task Title: Develop Progress Tracker for Learners

User Story: As a learner, I want to be able to track my progress for each course I am enrolled in, so that I can monitor my progress and know how much more I need to complete.

Description:

Develop a progress tracker that shows the percentage of the course completed, number of completed and remaining modules, and the ability to resume from where the learner left off.
The progress tracker should update in real-time as the learner completes modules and be accessible and user-friendly.
The progress tracker should be displayed on the learner's dashboard or on each course page.
The progress tracker should work seamlessly with the LMS platform and course content.
The progress tracker should be optimized for mobile devices as well as desktops.
The progress tracker should also have the option for learners to mark specific modules as complete, in case they have completed them offline or outside of the LMS platform.
Acceptance Criteria:
The progress tracker accurately displays the percentage of the course completed.
The progress tracker displays the number of completed and remaining modules.
The progress tracker allows learners to resume from where they left off.
The progress tracker updates in real-time as learners complete modules.
