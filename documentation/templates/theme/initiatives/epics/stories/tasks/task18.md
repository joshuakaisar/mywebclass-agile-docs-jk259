Task Title: Create a feedback form and report

User Story: As a website user, I want to provide feedback to the website administrator, so that my concerns can be addressed and improvements can be made to the website.

Description: The task is to create a feedback form that will capture the user's name, email address, feedback type, and feedback message. The feedback form should be user-friendly and accessible to all users. Once the user submits the feedback form, the data should be stored in a database for future reference. The website should also send a confirmation message to the user acknowledging receipt of the feedback.

A report summarizing the feedback received from users and the actions taken to address the feedback should be created. The report should include the feedback type, the number of feedback received, and a summary of the feedback messages. The report should also include the action taken to address each feedback message.
