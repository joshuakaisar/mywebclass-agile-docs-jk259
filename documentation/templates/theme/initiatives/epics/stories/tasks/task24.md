Task Title: Develop a Personalized Learning Path for Each Learner

User Story: As a learner, I want to have a personalized learning path based on my skills, interests, and learning objectives, so that I can have a more tailored learning experience and achieve my goals effectively.

Description:

Develop a system that creates a personalized learning path for each learner based on their skills, interests, and learning objectives. The system should analyze data on each learner's performance, interactions with the platform, and learning preferences, to generate a personalized learning path that adapts as the learner progresses.

The system should allow learners to set and modify their learning objectives and track their progress towards achieving them. The learning path should include recommended courses, modules, and learning resources, with personalized sequencing and pacing, based on the learner's proficiency and learning style.

The system should also provide recommendations for supplementary resources and learning opportunities, such as webinars, workshops, and peer-to-peer learning, to enhance the learner's knowledge and skills.

The personalized learning path should be accessible from the learner's dashboard and should be seamlessly integrated with the LMS platform.
