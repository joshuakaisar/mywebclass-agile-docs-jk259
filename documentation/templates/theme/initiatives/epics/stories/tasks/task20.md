My apologies for that. How about this one:

Task Title: Implement Two-Factor Authentication for User Accounts

User Story: As a user of the website, I want to have the option to enable two-factor authentication for my account so that my account is more secure.

Description:

Implement a two-factor authentication feature that users can enable for their accounts. When two-factor authentication is enabled, users will be required to enter a unique code from an authentication app, in addition to their username and password, each time they log in. This will provide an additional layer of security to user accounts.

Acceptance Criteria:

The two-factor authentication feature is implemented using a reliable and secure authentication app.
Users can enable or disable two-factor authentication in their account settings.
When two-factor authentication is enabled, users are prompted to enter a unique code from their authentication app each time they log in.
The two-factor authentication feature is compatible with different devices and screen sizes.
