Task Title: Develop a dashboard for instructors to track learner progress

User Story: As an instructor, I want to be able to track my learners' progress in a course so that I can provide appropriate guidance and support.

Description: Develop a dashboard for instructors that displays detailed information about learners' progress in a course. The dashboard should include the following:

Overview of the course, including the number of learners enrolled, completion rate, and average progress
Individual learner progress, including the percentage of the course completed, the number of completed and remaining modules, and the ability to view detailed progress reports
Detailed progress reports for each learner, including the date and time each module was completed, the score received on each quiz or assessment, and any feedback provided by the learner or instructor
Option to send messages to learners directly from the dashboard to provide guidance and support
The dashboard should be user-friendly, accessible, and provide real-time updates as learners complete modules and assessments.
