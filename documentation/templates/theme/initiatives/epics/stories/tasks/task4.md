Task Title: Develop Learner Progress Dashboard

User Story: As a learner, I want to be able to track my progress in real-time, so that I can monitor my performance and identify areas where I need to improve.

Description: Develop a dashboard that displays learners' progress in each course. The dashboard should show a summary of progress, including the number of courses completed, the percentage of courses completed, and the percentage of quizzes and assignments completed. The dashboard should also provide detailed information about each course, including the course name, instructor name, and course progress. The user should be able to click on a course to see detailed information about their performance in that course, including their quiz and assignment scores, the number of attempts made, and the time spent on each quiz or assignment. The dashboard should be responsive and accessible, and should integrate with the LMS platform.
